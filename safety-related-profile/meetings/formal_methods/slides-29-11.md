# SONNX
## Formal methods meeting #2

---
# **Objective** and **outputs** of the meeting
- Objectives 
  - Do we need formal techniques in the context of SONNX?
    - NO: *thank you and bye-bye!*
    - YES:  **For what purpose?  Using which language, tools?**
- Outputs
  - A clear statement of the purpose of FMs in SONNX
  - A formalisation strategy
  - A formalism
  - A short term workplan

---
# Why would we **need** formal methods?
## To express the semantics of operations and graph execution unambiguously?
  - &#x1F608; Will the spec be something different from the algorithm/code? 
  - &#x1F608; Wouldn't it be simpler to provide a straightforward, traceable and verified implementation, i.e., "Operation X is what is realized by the following reference code...". 
    - How would we account for difference in low-level implementation?
    -  Example: [Arm's TOSA](https://www.mlplatform.org/tosa/tosa_spec.html#_conv2d)
  - &#x1F608; Are FMs really necessary considering the (simple) operators at stake?
  - &#x1F608; Will the usage of a cryptic formalism simplify the task of developers?
  

---
# Why would we **need** formal methods?
## To verify the specification (completeness, absence of inconsistencies...)?
## To describe the algorithm and verify it against the specification?
  - Example with Why3 (Clochard et al, [The Matrix Reproved](https://inria.hal.science/hal-01617437/document))

---
# Why would we **need** formal methods?
## To verify the reference implementation of the algorithm?
- &#x1F608; Is it really necessary considering that this is a one-shot effort?
## To generate a the reference implementation?
- &#x1F608; Is it really necessary considering that this is a one-shot effort?


---
# Applied on what?
- Operations (esp. Tensor operations)
  - Specification of the ONNX operators (possibly on the vasis of a library of basic operators (e.g., linear algebra))
- Graph of operations 
  - Specification of what is a graph (what it is composed of?), how are graph executed?
- ONNX format?
  - Give a formal semantic to the ONNX "language"?

---
# Using which language, tools?
- Using "Pen and paper" specification (Loïc)
- Using some specification languages (ACSL, Why3, Coq, other)
  - Which one? 
- What are the expected properties of a formal specification langage in our contex?
  - Clarity? Understandability (by non experts)
  - Expressivity?
  - Support of tools?
- What do we expect from the formal language?
- What expertize do we have at hand 
	- Why3?, ACSL, other?

---
# What we have done yet?
- First exercize on the `CONV2D` operator using Why3 and ACSL, see [here]()

---	
# Issues
- Formal specification of floating point operations 
  - What do we want to specify, precisely?
