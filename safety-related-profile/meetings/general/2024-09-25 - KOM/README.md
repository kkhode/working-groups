  - Overall presentation of the workgroup
  - Brief introduction about the problematics in the aeronautics domain
  - List of "issues" already identified in ONNX
  - Example of what could be achieved by the WG
  - Workplan
  - Short term actions
- Brief presentation of Bosch interest in the WG. Bosch has developed an in-house ACG that'll be commercialized soon. Initial focus on the automotive market but may be used in any other industrial domain.
