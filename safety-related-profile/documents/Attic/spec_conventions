# Operator specification conventions

**This is a DRAFT** to be completed. 

## Specification principles

The specification follows the following *principles*.

1.  We are only concerned with the syntactic and semantics elements
    concerning the **inference**. All ONNX constructs dealing with
    training are out of the scope of the Safety-Related Standard.

2.  We distinguish an *informal* and a *formal* specification. The
    *informal* part is aimed at facilitating the understanding of the
    ONNX construct (e.g., operator). It may be incomplete, as far as it
    is clearly indicated. Conversely, the *formal* specification shall
    be absolutely complete and non ambiguous.

3.  Using mathematical formalism shall be avoided if not required. Since
    we are essentially[^1] targeting data and computer scientists, using
    a very cryptic – yet perfectly well defined and mathematically
    grounded – notation may reveal being error prone and, consequently,
    counter effective.

4.  The specification can rely on a formal language, as far as this
    language does not violate rule (2) above.
